# personal scripts

**HEY THERE! There's no need for you (the lovely end-user) to keep this folder. Same for the `../archived` folder, come to think of it.** 

These are just some quick scripts I've written to implement `checksum-tracker` in our org's transfer and backup strategy.

Feel free to take them as inspiration. Just know that they have nothing to do with `checksum-tracker`'s basic functionality. :)
